Look at EdX authoring

EdX is working with Berkeley (but all Stats and CS now). It doesn't seem like there is any way to sign up to write content from their site, I'm assuming you need to go through Berkeley to offer a course. Their code is open-source, and they use an authoring tool called Studio. I'll go on github and take a look.... http://code.edx.org/
