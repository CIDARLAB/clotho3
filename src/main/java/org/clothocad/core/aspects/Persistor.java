/**
 * @author jcanderson
 * 
 * Manages writing/reading objects to/from the DB, and will eventually also coordinate that with caching
 * Right now is a very simple pass-through class.
 * 
 * queries do not check the cache
 * 
 * fooAsBSON does not check or populate the cache - maintaining a separate BSON cache would be complicating but might help performance-wise
 * 
 * should probably get the cache to cooperate with the object deserializer (or pass the cache in for query methods)
 * possible refactoring: separate deserializer from connection?
 * 
 * having multiple threads have access to the same object sounds like a recipe for disaster -
 * Persistor should hand out copies
