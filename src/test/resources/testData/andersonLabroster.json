In order to fulfill this promise, a set of core design activities must be made more amenable to design automation techniques. The first step requires identifying DNA sequences of interest and packaging them as \"standard parts\". Once these parts have been created, the next step is to construct composite \"devices\". Finally, devices must be physically created with samples in the lab. Each of these stages has a number of sub-problems and each is equally important in the overall design process.

After receiving his PhD he was a UC Chancellor s post doctoral researcher both at UC Berkeley and the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI).

		"title": "Clotho: BioCAD tools for synthetic biology",
		"description": "Douglas initiated the development of Clotho while at Berkeley and continues to spearhead the effort from BU. Clotho is a software platform for designing and assemblying synthetic biological systems. It provides a mechanism to connect repositories of genetic parts with a wide variety of apps designed to use that information. These Apps provide the functionality and user interfaces that enable data management, automation of design tasks, visualization and simulation, control of liquid handling robotics, sample management, sharing data, or anything else that you might think to do with the data. Clotho provides a data model which is consistent with the needs of the synthetic biology community and provides access to it via an easy to use API. Most importantly, anyone can write a Clotho App with basic knowledge of Java programming using this API. Clotho is an open source project with collaborations at Boston University, UC Berkeley, MIT, BBN Technologies, and the BioFAB. For more complete information, please visit the website at http://www.clothocad.org.\n\nAdditionally, Douglas developed the domain specific language  Eugene  for synthetic biological systems. Eugene allows for both the specification of synthetic biological designs based on biological parts, as well as providing a very expressive constraint system to drive the automatic creation of composite Devices from a collection of individual Parts. Eugene allows for the rapid design space exploration of composite devices by permuting individual devices using available parts and rules for their composition. Eugene then communicates with the Clotho design environment in order to interface with liquid handing robots for an automated assembly flow for synthetic biology.",

The second plasmid was a single-copy BAC with an R6K origin of replication and genes under the control of T7 promoters. Under iron limitation, the controller is OFF and the BAC replicates at single copy, and the T7 promoters are OFF. In iron-rich media, the controller is on, and the BAC replicates to high copy and the promoters turn on. The controller was demonstrated as part of the iGEM project, and then pursued further after the competition. Though there are no papers about the device, its construction is described on the iGEM wiki.\n\n",

		"title": "Principle Investigator-title",
		"biography": "As an undergraduate, I was interested in polymer chemistry and pursued applications of polymeric surfactants in supercritical CO2 with Joe DeSimone at UNC. I became increasingly interested in enzymes and protein engineering during those years and was introduced to molecular evolution techniques in Edward Collins immunology lab.  I sought studies in the area of protein engineering and combinatorial methods at The Scripps Research Institute. My graduate work with Peter Schultz was on the site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids, with a specific focus on four-base codons. Near the end I became more interested in the influence of chassis and specific problems related to amino acid metabolism. We demonstrated we could biosynthesize p-aminophenylalanine and then incorporate it into protein. We also showed that we could knockout catabolic pathways and incorporate an alpha-hydroxy acid into protein to form an ester linkage in the backbone. These explorations of systems-level engineering led me to work with Adam Arkin and Chris Voigt for my postdoc at UC Berkeley and UCSF where we explored the idea of E. coli-derived therapeutic bacteria for the elimination of tumors. When I started my lab, I in part continued the work on therapeutic bacteria for several years, but my focus shifted to the technology of genetic engineering. It was clear that there were many foundational challenges associated with doing genetic engineering of systems at this elevated complexity. My lab now focuses on addressing these bottlenecks and integrating new technologies like deep sequencing and multiplex oligonucleotide synthesis into workflows. Central to these technologies are BioCAD tools that automate and manage the large amount of information involved in these projects. Generally, our goal is to modify the practice of genetic engineering to simplify it, reduce uncertainty, reduce risk, and facilitate the identification of new applications.",
