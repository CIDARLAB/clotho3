However, often what we want to know quantitatively how much of that protein will get made in the cell, and for this we must somehow model translation.  This turns out to be quite challenging, but let's start with the most basic model."

Modifying this region of a part is usually the best place to alter expression levels in the cell.  Modeling the relationship between sequence and expression level can be handled in multiple ways, but in this paper, relative expression levels are predicted using models that include notions of RNA secondary structure."

Because protein expression is a common activity in industry, there is a large driver for understanding the relationship between sequence and expression level. In recent years, the availability of GFP and the ability to synthesize gene-length DNAs at scale has led to a 'big data' approach to the problem.  I use this term 'big data' loosely.  As of yet, we aren't dealing with terabyte-scale data in synthetic biology, but we would if we could.  The essential idea of these experiments is that a very large number of datapoints is collected, and then software is used to construct models that encapsulate the patterns present in this data."
