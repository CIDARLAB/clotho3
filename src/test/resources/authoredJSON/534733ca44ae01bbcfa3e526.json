  "title" : "The Tulga Controller",
  "description" : "The Tulga Controller was a two plasmid system developed by David during the iGEM bactoblood project. It contained one controller plasmid encoding iron-inducible pir and T7 RNA polymerase genes. The second plasmid was a single-copy BAC with an R6K origin of replication and genes under the control of T7 promoters. Under iron limitation, the controller is OFF and the BAC replicates at single copy, and the T7 promoters are OFF. In iron-rich media, the controller is on, and the BAC replicates to high copy and the promoters turn on. The controller was demonstrated as part of the iGEM project, and then pursued further after the competition. Though there are no papers about the device, its construction is described on the iGEM wiki.\n\n",
