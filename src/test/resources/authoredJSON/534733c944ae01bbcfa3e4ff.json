  "title" : "Clotho",
  "description" : "Clotho is a toolset designed in a platform-based design paradigm to consolidate all these tools into one working, integrated toolbox. Clotho is based on a core-and-hub system which manages multiple connections, each connection performing tasks in some self-sufficient manner while connected to all other connections via the core. Examples of connections include sequence viewers/editors, parts database managers, assembly algorithm GUIs, and much more. Computer-savvy biologists can create new connections which will then be integrated into Clotho. These pieces can be kept locally in ones lab or made public and shared with the community. In this tool-consolidation and customization it is hoped that, in the future, biologists need not look further for a program that provides the answer to their ever growing design needs",
