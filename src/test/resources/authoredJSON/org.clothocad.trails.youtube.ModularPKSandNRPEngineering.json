Many of them are fungi or bacteria that simply aren't genetically tractable.  The difficulty of installing a DNA into a cell is what primarily determines how many genetic constructs you can test in an experiment.  Because of this fundamental bottleneck, it is far easier to engineer a pathway once you have moved it into a genetically-easy organism like E. coli or Yeast."
