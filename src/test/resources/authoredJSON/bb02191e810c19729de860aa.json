The Eugene language provides facilities to specify a system of parts and devices, as well as rules to constraining their composition. The overarching goal is that Eugene becomes the clear language of choice for user-level design specifications within the synthetic biology domain.</p><p><small>Boston University</small></p></blockquote>",
