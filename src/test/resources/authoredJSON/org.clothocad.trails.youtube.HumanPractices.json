It has become a popular term referring to diverse aspects of how technology interacts with people's lives. The term is often reduced to simply 'practices' and the scope of its meaning is increasingly broad. Synthetic Biology practitioners use this term to refer to issues of biosafety and biosecurity, intellectual property, government regulation, public perception, and education."
