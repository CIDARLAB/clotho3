  "description" : "Synthetic biology promises to introduce a new paradigm to the biological world. One which is less of a design science and more of an engineering discipline. In order to fulfill this promise, a set of core design activities must be made more amenable to design automation techniques. The first step requires identifying DNA sequences of interest and packaging them as \"standard parts\". Once these parts have been created, the next step is to construct composite \"devices\". Finally, devices must be physically created with samples in the lab. Each of these stages has a number of sub-problems and each is equally important in the overall design process. Our project focuses on the latter two processes, device creation and physical assembly. This web page has been designed to introduce you to our project so that you can not only learn more about our activities and use the associated tools but also contribute and collaborate with us! Specifically, our project is organized around the development of three tools: Eugene - A domain specific language for the specification of biological constructs. Spectacles - A visual editing framework for the design of composite biological devices and the assignment of physical samples to functional concepts. Kepler Integration - Development of actors and automated assembly processes for the scientific workflow management system Kepler.",
