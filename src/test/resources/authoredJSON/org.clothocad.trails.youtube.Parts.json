We call these Parts, and there are different kinds of parts such as coding sequences, promoters, RNAs, and the like. In some cases, parts correspond to specific molecules that are encoded by the sequence, such as protein coding sequences and RNAs. In other cases, they correspond to regions of a DNA that proteins act upon with consistent affect, such as promoters and origins of replication."

At the DNA level, the region of the sequence that is directly translated 3-bases at a time into protein is called the CDS, or 'CoDing Sequence'.  The proteins that get made into parts are useful by virtue of their molecular function. If you were to write out some arbitrary protein sequence, there is little chance that this protein would fold into a structure and have a function.  However, rare sequences participate in highly-specific and complicated interactions with other molecules."
