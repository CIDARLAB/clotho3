By identifying promoters under the control of these transcription factors, you can restrict a gene's expression to specific tissues.  Additionally, some promoters are only transiently expressed during a particular phase of development allowing temporal restriction of gene expression.In this study, Liu and coworkers employ a transcriptional control element specific to flower development to control a toxic protein's production.  Thus, they can programmatically eliminate flower formation."
