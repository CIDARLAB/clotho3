        "params" : "The most basic type of promoter you can have in a prokaryote are constitutive promoters. These promoters initiate mRNA synthesis independent of the influence of regulation.  The term 'constititive expression' is more commonly defined as 'Expression of a gene that is transcribed at a constant level'. This idea of 'constant' expression turns out to be a very fuzzy concept that our field still grapples with.  In practice, transcription rates depend highly on the physiology of the cell, and thus in practice one never observes true 'constant' or even 'consistent' expression.  Thus, I'll give it a more concrete but specific biochemistry-based definition -- a constitutive promoter is one whose observed states only include free and sigma-factor-bound species."
