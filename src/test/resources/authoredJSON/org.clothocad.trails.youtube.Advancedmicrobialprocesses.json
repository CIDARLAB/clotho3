Because it is often very expensive to purify biochemical components for such procedures, using cells to do common DNA manipulation processes is often a good strategy for performing many operations in parallel on robots.  One very popular cloning method today is yeast recombination.  If you construct linear, double-stranded DNAs that overlap at their ends, the introduce them in S. cerevisiae by transformation, the DNA repair machinery of the cell will join the DNAs together into larger molecules.  This reaction is the basis for the Venter approach to genome engineering.  Many strategies, however, exist including the use of cell lysates and more complex engineered processes."
