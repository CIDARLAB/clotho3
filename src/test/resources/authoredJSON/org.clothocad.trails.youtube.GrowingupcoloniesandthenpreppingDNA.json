      "params" : "After transformation and plating, colonies should appear in about 16 hours (the next day).  You now need to pick the colonies into test tubes to grow up enough bacteria for a miniprep.  In the miniprep, you extract plasmid DNA from around 2mL of cells.  The result is pure DNA that can be confirmed by sequencing. \n\nDepending on how many samples you have, you may wish to grow the colonies in a block rather than individual tubes.  We'll explain how to do both.  We'll show how to use the Miniprep kit to purify DNA from a small number of samples, but variant protocols can be found on youtube that employ vacuum manifolds for more samples."

But surprisingly, you can save up to 10 minutes by doing the wash steps on a vacuum device."
