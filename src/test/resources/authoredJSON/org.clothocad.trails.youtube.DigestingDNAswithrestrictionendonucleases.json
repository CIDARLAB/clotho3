      "params" : "Any pure DNA sample can be subjected to digestion with restriction endonucleases.  These enzymes make precise double-stranded cuts to specific regions of sequence within the DNA.  You can digest genomic DNAs, plasmid DNAs, PCR products, and the like. However, the DNA must be purified by an appropriate cleanup or extraction kit prior to digestion.  First we'll see how to purify PCR products with the DNA Clean & Concentrator™ from Zymo Research, then we'll do a digestion."
