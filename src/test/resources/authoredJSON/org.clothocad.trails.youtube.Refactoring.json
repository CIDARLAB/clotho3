In this study, Voigt and coworkers refactored the nitrogen fixation gene cluster from Klebsiella.  The ultimate goal is to make these genes portable such that nitrogen fixation could be transferred to other organisms such as plants.  In these experiments, they demonstrate the first steps of the process wherein they are able to functionally replace the Klebsiella cluster with the refactored copy."

However, I want you to understand what goes on inside the more complex gene clusters to see the diversity of processes that can occur.  There are many 'advanced' gene clusters in prokaryotes.  Magnetosomes are another really popular example.  In terms of us having extensive knowledge about what is encoded by these clusters in molecular terms, no process is better studied than photosynthesis.  Thus, I will describe to you how this process works and how you might approach refactoring it.  Refactoring photosystems is one of the problems on the 10-year horizon for our field, but is impractical with existing infrastructure.  Nevertheless, it is a good example for thinking through how to approach designing biology in modules."
