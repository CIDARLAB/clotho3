Usually that sample is a cell like E. coli, yeast, or mammalian cells. Alternatively, that sample could be a reconstituted in vitro system made from transcription and translation proteins and RNAs that were isolated from some cell.  Regardless, there are core central dogma processes that must be present to have a biological system. When we speak of a chassis, we are referring to this sample that provides the central dogma processes."
