There are additional considerations such as the choice of controls and choice of experimental conditions that must be including in the Test phase.  We'll describe 4 specific areas of information one needs to extract from an assay.  In differential expression, you are comparing a strain's function under two or more environmental conditions.  In a transfer function, you are continuously varying some environmental parameter and trying to produce a function relating the output behavior to this input.  Dynamics involves following the system over time with your assay.  Finally, population heterogeneity involves performing your assay on individual members of the cell population."

Instead of just shifting from one steady state to another and staying there, the cells deal with stress—such as the lack of food—by activating a regulatory protein in steady pulses. The cell cranks up the frequency of the pulses if there's more stress. By attaching fluorescent proteins to the genetic circuit responsible for B. subtilis's stress response, the researchers can observe each pulse as a green flash. This video shows the pulsating cells as they multiply over the course of more than 12 hours. To read more on the research, go to http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13470.
