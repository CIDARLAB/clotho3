  "description" : "The necessity of inexpensive, disease-free, and universally compatible blood substitutes is undisputed. There are currently no blood substitutes approved for use in the US or the UK, and whole blood is almost always in short supply. Developing countries have the greatest need for blood transfusions, yet many lack the necessary donation and storage infrastructure and the required pool of healthy donors. To address this problem, we are developing a cost-effective red blood cell substitute constructed from engineered E. coli bacteria. Our system is designed to safely transport oxygen in the bloodstream without inducing sepsis, and to be stored for prolonged periods in a freeze-dried state.",
