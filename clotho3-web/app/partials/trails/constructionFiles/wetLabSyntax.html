  <p>Wet labs often use human-readable construction files to succinctly describe a set of reactions.</p>

  <p>These construction files often refer to <b>Parts</b>, or DNA sequences with an encapsulated function, by name. For example, <code>pUC19</code> is a plasmid backbone, and referred to by name in our GFP cloning.</p>
