    <h3>Saving Generated Devices</h3>

    <p> Now that we have modified our Eugene file to also include another part from the Public Registry, the set of devices we generate will be larger. In the case of this example, we get two additional inverters.
    <p> To save our generated devices, click on the 'Generated Parts' tab and hit 'Save All'. You can choose files to save individually with the Save buttons if you prefer. Now, when you return to Clotho, your generated inverters will be listed with the other parts in the database.
