Additional metadata easily can be added in Clotho.</p><p>You can specify sequences (like <code>primer1</code>) directly in the construction file, or reference sequences stored in Clotho (like <code>pPROBE_GFP</code> or <code>pUC19</code>).</p><p>As you run the simulation, terms will be colored as they are defined.</p><p><b>Try editing the wet lab construction file below</b>, and the interface will update in realtime.</p><div construction-parser-json="demoWetLab"></div></div>
