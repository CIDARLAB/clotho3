<!-- fifth way --- bootstrap a widget every time -->

<div>
    <h2>Bootstrap With Dependencies</h2>

    <div class="alert alert-info">Components that are useful elsewhere should be added to the parent app</div>

    <p>Here, a lowercaseG filter has been added:</p>

    <div class="well well-small" ng-init="seq = 'aaacccgggtttAAACCCGGGTTT'">
        Before: {{ seq }} <br /> After: {{ seq | dnaLowercaseG }}
    </div>

    <p>The Bootstrapped app is the same:</p>


    <div insertWidgetHere></div>
