    <h2>jQuery Mixin</h2>

    <p>It is likely that many developers will wish to stick to jQuery. Several jQuery extensions exist. jQuery is a language for manipulating the DOM, and as such it will likely reference the template being added to the page.</p>

        <p>This page demonstrates adding a jQuery plug-in - the Twitter TypeAhead extension has been added, try typing in the box below:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <b>script</b> and <b>dependencies</b> run before the template / video / etc. is loaded and compiled. A parameter <b>onload</b> may be used in the case where something must be run after the template has been added to the DOM - as is the case here. The typeahead plug-in is loaded via <b>dependencies</b>, and the jQuery binding it to the template is loaded via <b>onload</b>. <b>onload</b> is cache-busting (it simply calls Application.script after the template has been loaded).
