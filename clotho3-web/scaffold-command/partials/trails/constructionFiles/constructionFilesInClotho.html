  <p>The GFP cloning experiment is represented in the construction file interface below. After familiarizing yourself with the interface, in the next section you'll see how Clotho can parse wet-lab construction files.</p>

  <p>Sequences input into each step are represented as a token, like the one below.</p>

  <p>Tokens which are defined will be colored. Clotho will automatically check the database for terms not defined in the Construction File dictionary.</p>
