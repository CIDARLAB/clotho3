One way to express a Construction File is the human-readable format described below. The file is divided into two sections:  the operations and the dictionary. The first section describes the wetlab operations that would result in the desired product, expressed in one line per step. The bottom section is the dictionary which lists any sequences referenced by name in the operations that are not in the database.
