This example construction file demonstrates proper format:
PCR ca581F/ca803R on pBAC874t	        (1060 bp, pcrproduct)
Digest pcrproduct                       (BsmBI/EcoRI, digestproduct1)
GelPurify digestproduct1                (L, pcrdig)
Digest pGLN                             (BamHI/EcoRI, digestproduct2)
GelPurify digestproduct2                (L, vectdig)
Ligate pcrdig/vectdig               	(pHA581)

See that the first word in each line is used as a key to determine the meaning of that line.
Currently supported first words and their meaning are listed below, in the format [first word] -> [meaning]:
Digest -> Digest reaction
gelPurify -> GelPurify reaction
Ligate -> Ligation reaction
PCR -> PCR reaction
EIPCR -> EIPCR reaction

Also note that the product of each reaction step must be explicitly referenced. This is necessary to resolve any possible ambiguity.

Arguments in square brackets ("[]") are necessary, arguments with a * in front of them ("*[]") are optional and can be left out without consequence.

Parentheses are required. Arguments within the parentheses can be in any order, and must be delimited using commas.

For a PCR reaction:
PCR [oligo names] on [template name] ([product name], *[numerical product size])

Note: [oligo names] should contain no spaces, and names should be separated by a '/' (i.e. ca1015F/R or 605F/803R)

For an EIPCR reaction:
EIPCR [oligo names] on [template name] ([product name], *[numerical product size])

Formatting requirements are the same as for PCR. Note that this is necessary to tell Clotho that [template name] is circular.

For a Digestion reaction:
Digest [template name] ([enzymes], [product name], *[sizes], *[choice])

Note: [enzymes] should contain no spaces, and names should be separated by a '/' (i.e. EcoRI/SpeI). Numerical values inside [sizes] should be delimited by a '+' (i.e. [1038+10+6]). Currently supported [choice] argument is 'L' for choosing the largest product.

For a Ligation reaction:
Ligate [sequence one]/[sequence two]/*[...] ([product name])

For a Gel Purification reaction:
gelPurify [template name] ([product name], *[target length])

Note: Currently supported [target length] argument is 'L' for choosing the largest product.

SOEing and PCA to be added.
